## About this repo

This project is a simple web server that handles GET requests for pages ending in .html and .css located in the pages subdirectory. Errors such as 404, simple 403 errors such as empty requests and forbidden characters ('..', '~'), and 401 as a catch-all for all unimplemented requests are also handled.
